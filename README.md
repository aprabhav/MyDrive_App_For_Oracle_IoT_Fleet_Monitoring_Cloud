# MyDrive_App_For_Oracle_IoT_Fleet_Monitoring_Cloud
MyDrive android mobile app could be used for not only tracking the location of a vehicle but also for driver behavior monitoring.
The app connects to Oracle IoT Fleet Monitoring Cloud to report the vehicle location, vehicle speed and application running duration.
It also reports the events such as harsh acceleration/braking/cornering, over idling to Oracle IoT Fleet Monitoring Cloud to monitor the driver behavior.

This app could be used as a replacement for a tracking device (such as OBD 2) in a car.
However, note that the app does not (and can not) report on the vehicle engine parameters!!!

The application uses the GPS and Accelerometer present in the android phone.

Please refer the "MyDrive Android Mobile App User Guide" (uploaded as part of the project itself) for more information on how to use this application.

Once you connect the app to Oracle IoT Fleet Monitoring Cloud (Oracle IoT FM) then you would be able to use the featurs of Oracle IoT FM application to view the driver bahvior scores and the trip details etc. See below some of the screenshots of Iot FM application console.
